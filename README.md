# WPF FTP Client

A Windows FTP client developed using Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF).

## Appearance and Functionality

The application is a classic dual-pane file manager.

**Key UI Elements:**

*   **Connection Panel (left)**: Used to enter connection details for the FTP server.
*   **Local Files Panel (center)**: Displays the local computer's file system.
*   **Remote Files Panel (right)**: After a successful connection, this panel displays the files and folders on the FTP server.
*   **Toolbars**: Above each file panel, there are buttons for navigation (`<`, `>`, `â†‘`) and file management (create folder, rename, delete, download/upload).
*   **Log Panel (bottom)**: Shows the connection status, commands sent to the server, and its responses.

The application is built based on the **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)** architectural pattern.

## Project Structure

*   `Commands`: Implementation of the Command pattern (e.g., `RelayCommand`) for handling user actions.
*   `Converters`: Data converters for WPF bindings.
*   `Enums`: Enumerations defining types and states within the application.
*   `Helpers`: Helper classes and utilities.
*   `Models`: Classes describing data entities (e.g., file, log message).
*   `Resources`: Application resources, including styles (`.xaml`) and custom controls (`Controls`).
*   `Services`: Services encapsulating business logic (FTP operations, file system access, logging).
*   `ViewModels`: ViewModel classes that manage UI logic and state.
*   `Views`: XAML views (windows and user controls).
